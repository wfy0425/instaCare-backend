### Introduction:
The Covid-19 global pandemic has drastically changed the lifestyle of the majority of us. While most of us could simply stay at home and shop online, some seniors are experiencing a really tough time. They are the group of people that need most help during this pandemic. InstaCare, an online platform that connects seniors and volunteers, helps to alleviate the situations when seniors are unable to do something on their own, such as buying food or seeking medication. InstaCare helps both seniors and volunteers feel better, live better during the pandemic. As a registered senior, you can request for help, or an errand, on our plaza, and provide tips to volunteer when they accept your request. For registered volunteers, you can help seniors in need of your neighborhood.

#### Known Bugs
1. Uploading a new avatar sometimes results in no change and no error message. This error is related to the user's system version and browser. Try to either check the image’s size, try another image, wait a few seconds longer, or refresh the page. 
2. Current version of application does not allow running applications on two tabs with different accounts in the same browser. If you want to test the behavior of multiple users, either log out and then log in with different accounts, or log in on another device.
3. For users in regions with google access limited, our location sharing feature might not function correctly. Try to access our application with VPN on.
4. If the user's current location is too far from the locations of any posts existing in our database (ie. other states or countries), the location sharing feature might not function properly, and there might be no planning routes. Try to zoom in/zoom out/drag to move the map, or give it little more time to run. For users in the area near UCSD this should not be a problem. 
5. For some browsers like Chrome, once you have confirmed to grant the access to share your location, the next time you use our application it will automatically give the access if needed, and the confirmation box will not appear. Currently no good fix to it, but it will only affect the alternative workflow of TC16. We suggest to test the alternative workflow before testing the regular workflow for this test.
6. For some browsers the alignment of elements might be weird. Try using a different browser (Chrome preferred) or refresh the page.
7. For multiple users using the application, the updated information might not update to the page immediately after change. Try to reload the page.
8. In the case the pop up window is in the wrong place and buttons are hidden, try to adjust the display percentage of the browser. 75% displaying size should fix most of it. We have fixed the bug in where we observed, but in case you encounter more during the testing.
9. When the request is over one might still observe the location of the other if the other user chooses to share the location. Currently no good fix to it
